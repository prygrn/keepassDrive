# Keepass automatic launcher with Google Drive

This tool automatically downloads your keepass database from your Google Drive and opens it to be ready to be consulted.
When exiting, it will check if there is any differences between the remote and the local ones. If any, it will upload the local to the remote to be up-to-date.
